RELEASES release candidate! :-)


I think it would be better to merge struct fuse_chan into struct
fuse_session (because there is always exactly one channel object
associated with one session object with pointers in both directions),
and then use a reduced struct fuse_chan only for the additional
channels created by fuse_loop_mt (in particular, remove the session
reference which is always null anyway).

This would also allow us to remove the fuse_session_add_chan and
fuse_session_remove_chan functions which are rather pointless, since
there is only ever one channel per session - so we may just as well
create and destroy the channel together with the session.
